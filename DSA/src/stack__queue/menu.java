/*Implement Stack from Scratch
Implement Queue from Scratch
Implement 2 stack in an array
find the middle element of a stack
Implement "N" stacks in an Array
Check the expression has valid or Balanced parenthesis or not.
Reverse a String using Stack
Design a Stack that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra space.
Find the next Greater element
The celebrity Problem--imporvmet
Arithmetic Expression evaluation--not yet
Evaluation of Postfix expression-not yet
Implement a method to insert an element at its bottom without using any other data structure.
Reverse a stack using recursion-done
Sort a Stack using recursion--same upper line follow put method but difference way ok k- value arr[i]
Merge Overlapping Intervals-yese
Largest rectangular Area in Histogram--future
Length of the Longest Valid Substring-like checking isbalaceBracket but only if(ch=="("continue switch(c) ch =s.pop() if(ch=")"count++:
Expression contains redundant bracket or not--switch(x) after ch.pop() count++; till st is equal to zero 
Implement Stack using Queue
Implement Stack using Deque
Stack Permutations (Check if an array is stack permutation of other)
Implement Queue using Stack  
Implement "n" queue in an array
Implement a Circular queue
LRU Cache Implementationa
Reverse a Queue using recursion
Reverse the first “K” elements of a queue
Interleave the first half of the queue with second half
/*-Minimum time required to rot all oranges
Distance of nearest cell having 1 in a binary matrix
First negative integer in every window of size “k”
Check if all levels of two trees are anagrams or not.
Sum of minimum and maximum elements of all subarrays of size “k”.
Minimum sum of squares of character counts in a given string after removing “k” characters.
Queue based approach or first non-repeating character in a stream.
